{-| Support for Javascript events.

There are more specific modules available for more specific types of events --
for instance, `WebAPI.Event.BeforeUnload` for the `BeforeUnloadEvent`. So, if
you're interested in a specific type of event, check there first.

Also, there are specific modules available for some targets. For instance,
`WebAPI.Window` has some convenient event-handling methods.

Furthermore, if you are using
[evancz/elm-html](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/evancz/elm-html/latest),
this is not really meant for targets that are within the `Html` that your
`view` function produces. For those, use `Html.Events` to deal with events.
Instead, this is meant for events on target that you don't set up in your
`view` function, such as the `window` and `document` etc. Though, of course,
you could possibly achieve some interesting results by setting up listeners on
the document or window and relying on bubbling.

See Mozilla documentation for the
[`EventTarget` interface](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget),
and for [`Event`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event).
I also found this
[list of events](http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/dom_obj_event.asp)
helpful.

{-| The phase in which the event is currently being processed.

Note that typically an undispatched `Event` will return `NoPhase`, but in
Opera will return `AtTarget`.
-}

{-| Has `preventDefault()` been called on this event? -}
defaultPrevented : Event -> Bool
defaultPrevented = Native.WebAPI.Event.defaultPrevented


{-| The target that the event was originally dispatched to. -}
eventTarget : Event -> Maybe Target
eventTarget = Native.WebAPI.Event.target


{-| The target that the current event listener was attached to. This may differ
from the target which originally received the event, if we are in the bubbling
or capturing phase.

construct
    (WebAPI.Event.Internal.Selector eventName)
    (WebAPI.Event.Internal.Options options className)
        = nativeConstruct className eventName options


{- The first param is the Javascript className. The second param
is the event name. The third is a list of parameters, in the order
in which initEvent etc. will want them.
-}
nativeConstruct : String -> String -> List (String, Json.Encode.Value) -> Task x event
nativeConstruct = Native.WebAPI.Event.construct


{-| Options for creating an event. -}
type alias Options event = WebAPI.Event.Internal.Options event


{-| Specify options for constructing an `Event`. -}

    -- Note that these must be in order according to what initEvent is going to want.

        , ("cancelable", Json.Encode.bool options.cancelable)

{-| Default options, in which `cancelable` and `bubbles` are both false. -}
defaultOptions : Options Event
defaultOptions =
    options
        { cancelable = False
        , bubbles = False
        }


{-| A task which dispatches an event, and completes when all the event handlers
have run. The task will complete with `True` if the default action should be
permitted.  If any handler calls `preventDefault()`, the task will return
`False`. The task will fail if certain exceptions occur.

To dispatch an event from a sub-module, use the submodule's `toEvent` method.
For instance, to dispatch a `CustomEvent`, do something like:

    dispatchCustomEvent : Target -> CustomEvent -> Task String Bool
    dispatchCustomEvent target customEvent =
        WebAPI.Event.dispatch target (WebAPI.Event.CustomEvent.toEvent customEvent)
-}

{-| Opaque type which represents a Javascript object which can respond to
Javascript's `addEventListener()` and `removeEventListener()`.

To obtain a `Target`, see methods such as `WebAPI.Document.target` and
`WebAPI.Window.target`.
-}
type Target = Target


{-| A task which, when executed, uses Javascript's `addEventListener()` to add
a `Responder` to the `Target` for the event specified by the `Selector`.

Succeeds with a `Listener`, which you can supply to `removeListener` if you
wish.
-}
addListener : ListenerPhase -> Selector event -> Responder event -> Target -> Task x Listener
addListener = Native.WebAPI.Listener.add


{-| Convenience method for the usual case in which you call `addListener`
for the `Bubble` phase.
-}
on : Selector event -> Responder event -> Target -> Task x Listener
on = addListener Bubble


{-| Like `addListener`, but only responds to the event once, and the resulting
`Task` only succeeds when the event occurs (with the value of the event object).
Thus, your `Responder` method might not need to do anything.
-}
addListenerOnce : ListenerPhase -> Selector event -> Responder event -> Target -> Task x event
addListenerOnce = Native.WebAPI.Listener.addOnce


{-| Like `addListenerOnce`, but supplies the default `Phase` (`Bubble`), and a
`Responder` that does nothing (so you merely chain the resulting `Task`).
-}
once : Selector event -> Target -> Task x event
once string target =
    addListenerOnce Bubble string noResponse target


-- This is basically here so that we can re-export it. We don't want to expose
-- it from the internal module, since we don't want clients to construct it
-- directly. But we can export it from here without the tag.
{-| Opaque type representing an event name which uses an event type. -}
type alias Selector event = WebAPI.Event.Internal.Selector event


{-| Select an event name using the `Event` type.

You can handle any event name with the `Event` type if you like, but often
you should use a more specific event type. For instance, for 'beforeunload`,
you should use `WebAPI.Event.BeforeUnload.select`, so that you can use a
`BeforeUnloadEvent` in your `Responder`.
-}

    | Bubble


{-| The listener's phase. -}
listenerPhase : Listener -> ListenerPhase
listenerPhase = Native.WebAPI.Listener.phase


{-| A task which will remove the supplied `Listener`.

Alternatively, you can return `remove` from your `Responder` method, and the
listener will be removed.
-}
removeListener : Listener -> Task x ()
removeListener = Native.WebAPI.Listener.remove


{- ----------
   Responding
   ---------- -}


{-| A function which will be called each time an event occurs, in order to
determine how to respond to the event.

* The `event` parameter is the Javascript event object.
* The `Listener` is the listener which is responsible for this event.

Your function should return a list of responses which you would like to make
to the event.

{-| Indicates that you would like to set a property on the event object with
the specified key to the specified value.

Normally, you should not need this. However, there are some events which need
to be manipulated in this way -- for instance, setting the `returnValue` on the
`beforeunload` event.

{-| Indicates that you would like to send a message in response to the event. -}
send : Signal.Message -> Response

{-| Indicates that you would like to perform a `Task` in response to the event.

If the task is to send a message via `Signal.send`, then you can use `send` as
a convenience.
-}
performTask : Task () () -> Response

{-| Indicates that no longer wish to listen for this event on this target. -}
remove : Response
remove = Remove


-- The idea here is that we don't want to expose these tasks generally, since
-- they mutate the event, and we don't want to *arbitrarily* mutate the event.
-- We only want to mutate the event as part of a response. So, the callback
-- becomes a kind of effects interpreter, and we only expose the effects
-- here, rather than the raw tasks. So, in effect, these are tasks that can
-- only be performed at a certain moment.


{-| Indicates that you would like to prevent further propagation of the event. -}
stopPropagation : Event -> Response
stopPropagation = PerformTask << stopPropagationNative


stopPropagationNative : Event -> Task x ()
stopPropagationNative = Native.WebAPI.Event.stopPropagation

target from being called.
